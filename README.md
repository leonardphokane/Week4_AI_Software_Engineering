## 🧩 Task Summaries

### ✅ Task 1: Bug Report Categorization
Uses keyword matching to automatically classify bug reports as `UI`, `Performance`, or `Security`. Helps QA engineers sort tickets faster.

### ✅ Task 2: Login Test Automation
Given a login form and a scenario prompt, this script generates Selenium-style test cases automatically using rule-based logic.

### ✅ Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` on breast cancer diagnostic data to predict issue priority. Includes data preprocessing, F1-score evaluation, and model saving.


> ✅ Accuracy: 96% | 🔁 Reusable Model Saved with joblib | 🎯 End-to-End ML Pipeline | 📊 Real-World Dataset | 📁 Structured Project


### ✅ Task 4: Design Suggestion Based on Requirements
Takes textual requirements and maps them to potential software design patterns using pattern matching and simple NLP logic.
