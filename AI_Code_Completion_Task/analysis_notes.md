ðŸ“Š Comparison and Efficiency Analysis (200 words):
The AI-generated function using sorted() is both more readable and efficient. Internally, Pythonâ€™s sorted() uses Timsort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it highly optimized for real-world datasets. Additionally, .get() provides a safe way to handle missing keys, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

In contrast, the manual implementation replicates a selection/bubble sort with a time complexity of O(nÂ²). It also assumes all dictionaries contain the specified keyâ€”making it less robust. This version is more error-prone, harder to maintain, and unsuitable for large datasets.

Ultimately, the AI-suggested solution is superior in terms of efficiency, maintainability, and error handling. Itâ€™s a good example of how Copilot can streamline common tasks by automatically applying best practices that developers might otherwise overlook.
