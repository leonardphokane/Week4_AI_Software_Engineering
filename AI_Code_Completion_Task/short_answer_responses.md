1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: How do AI-driven code generation tools reduce development time? What are their limitations? AI tools like GitHub Copilot accelerate development by suggesting context-aware code snippets, boilerplate structures, and even entire functions. This reduces time spent on repetitive tasks and helps developers focus on logic and architecture. Limitations include:

Context misunderstanding: AI may suggest incorrect or insecure code.

Over-reliance: Developers might accept suggestions without fully understanding them.

Limited domain knowledge: AI may struggle with niche or highly specialized codebases.

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in automated bug detection.

Supervised learning uses labeled data (e.g., known bugs vs. clean code) to train models that classify or predict bugs. It’s effective when historical bug data is available.

Unsupervised learning identifies anomalies or patterns without labeled data—useful for detecting unknown or emerging bugs by clustering or outlier detection. In practice, supervised models are more accurate for known issues, while unsupervised models are better at discovering novel or rare bugs.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical in AI-driven user experience personalization? Personalization algorithms trained on biased data can reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain user groups. For example, if an AI only recommends tech content to male users, it marginalizes others. Bias mitigation ensures fairness, inclusivity, and trust—especially important in diverse user bases. Tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 help detect and correct these biases.

2. Case Study Analysis: AIOps in Deployment Pipelines
How AIOps improves deployment efficiency:

AIOps enhances DevOps by automating monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making in deployment pipelines. It reduces manual intervention, speeds up releases, and improves reliability.

Example 1: Anomaly Detection AIOps tools can detect unusual spikes in CPU usage or failed builds during deployment. Instead of waiting for human intervention, the system can auto-trigger rollbacks or alerts.

Example 2: Predictive Scaling and Resource Optimization By analyzing historical deployment data, AIOps can predict when traffic will spike and pre-scale infrastructure accordingly—ensuring smooth rollouts without downtime.
