# Sort Dictionaries by Key â€“ AI Code Completion Task

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Copilot to implement a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key. It includes both an AI-suggested solution and a manually written version for comparison.

## ðŸš€ Objective
- Use AI code generation (GitHub Copilot) to generate a sorting function.
- Compare it with a manually coded solution.
- Determine which is more efficient and why.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `sort_dicts_by_key.py` â€“ Contains the AI-generated function, manual implementation, and sample data for testing.
- `analysis_notes.md` (optional) â€“ Summary of efficiency comparison and insights (can also be inlined here if you prefer one file).

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
1. Open `sort_dicts_by_key.py` in VS Code.
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python sort_dicts_by_key.py

3. Output will show the sorted list based on the chosen key.

ðŸ§  Key Learnings
Copilot provided a concise and robust implementation using Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted() function.

Manual implementation was less efficient (O(nÂ²)) and less flexible.

AI code generation tools save development time while encouraging best practices.
